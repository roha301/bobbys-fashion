# 🛍️ Bobby Sales — Backend API

Welcome to the **Bobby Sales** backend! This is the engine that powers our beautiful fashion discovery platform. 🚀

Built with speed and simplicity in mind, this REST API handles everything from products and categories to admin authentication, image uploads, and contact messages. 

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We keep it simple, fast, and modern:
- ⚡ **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** — A lightning-fast REST API framework for Python.
- 🗄️ **SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)** — Zero-config database that lives right in a single file (`bobby_sales.db`).
- 🔐 **JWT (python-jose)** — Secure admin authentication.
- 🛡️ **bcrypt** — Robust password hashing to keep our admins safe.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these easy steps to get the backend running locally on your machine!

### 1. Install Dependencies
First, let's set up a virtual environment and install the required packages.

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Seed the Database
We don't want an empty store! Let's fill the database with categories, 12 sample fashion products, and a default admin user.

```bash
python seed.py
```

> **🔑 Default Admin Login:**
> - **Username:** `admin`
> - **Password:** `bobbysales123`
> *(Make sure to change this immediately in production!)*

*Optional: If you want to use your own credentials right away, you can set them before running the script:*
```bash
export BOBBY_SALES_ADMIN_USER=youradmin
export BOBBY_SALES_ADMIN_PASSWORD=super-secret-password
python seed.py
```

### 3. Run the Server! 🎉
Start up the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**That's it!** The API is now live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

*(Note: The frontend's Vite dev server automatically proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to this backend. Just ensure both are running!)*

## 🚀 Going to Production? 

Keep these important tips in mind:
1. **Change the Secret:** Swap `BOBBY_SALES_SECRET_KEY` for a long, random value and store it outside of version control.
2. **Database:** SQLite is great for small setups. If you need horizontal scaling, swap it for Postgres by updating `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` in `database.py`.
3. **Storage:** Uploaded images are currently stored locally. Move to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage before scaling past one server.
4. **CORS:** Update the `allow_origins` list in `main.py` to only include your real frontend domain before deploying.
